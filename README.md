Here's a collection of random small web applications I've built over the years. I don't usually maintain them because they don't really require maintenence but feel free to create issues if there are any.

The mal.php file has an API key in it so it's not in the repo, and I don't want to deal with the hassle of hiding keys; just message me if you want the source.
